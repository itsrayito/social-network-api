## Description
This project is a social network back-end Node.js application where it provides the ability to perform CRUD operations on a databse which contains users, reactions to the users, and thoughts. The application will also steamline the database creation and maintenance process by allowing the user to focus on the front-end of the application and while the user can also perform CRUD operations on the database through API endpoints.
## Installation
1. The user needs to download Node.js, git, and npm.<br>
2. The user will then have to clone this repository in their chosen directory using the CLI (Command Line Interface)<br>
3. Final step will be to download npm dependencies by typing `npm install` in the CLI. The application uses both the mongoose and express npm packages.<br>
## Usage
In order to use this application, the user will have to navigate to the root folder in the cloned repository's directory and type in `npm start` in to the CLI in order to start and interact with the server.
## Features
The application will allow for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functions on thoughts, users, and reactions that are stored in the database within the API endpoints.
